          For our final project in the Multimedia Design program, my project partner and I conceptualized and produced a digital scrollytelling experience focused on Danish horse racing, highlighting its rich heritage. Our goal was to bring the history and essence of the sport to life in a fresh and engaging way, specifically targeting a younger audience. The project was well received, earning us the highest grade along with honors for our creativity, execution, and innovative approach.

          My study group and I redesigned the Copenhagen-based analog company CPH-Lab's website to enhance its digital identity and optimize the purchasing experience. Through a scrollytelling approach, we narrated the story of analog photography, creating an engaging journey for users. By combining a streamlined design with the one-thing-per-page strategy, we made the purchasing process more intuitive while preserving CPH-Lab’s visual identity and passion for analog film.

          with Nicolai Lorenzen, a Copenhagen-based freelance photographer. My
          team and I worked on redesigning his website and enhancing his digital
          presence. Our main objective was to attract more private clients while
          preserving his unique style. We received excellent responses from both
          the client and our teachers.
